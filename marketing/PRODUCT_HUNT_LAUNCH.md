# Product Hunt Launch Pack

## Tagline
**"Production-ready RAG system for GDPR-compliant document AI"**

## Description

### Short (100 chars)
TypeScript RAG template with Azure OpenAI. GDPR-compliant, EU-hosted, deploy in 1 day.

### Full Description

🚀 **Build document AI without the complexity**

RAG Template Starter is a production-ready, enterprise-grade system for building GDPR-compliant document chatbots. Built with TypeScript, Azure OpenAI, and Azure AI Search.

**Why this exists:**
Developers waste 200+ hours building RAG from fragmented tutorials. Most are Python-based, US-hosted, and not production-ready. This template saves that time.

**What's included:**
✅ Complete TypeScript codebase (strict mode)
✅ Azure-native stack (OpenAI, AI Search, Blob Storage)
✅ GDPR by design (EU data residency, Sweden Central)
✅ Terraform infrastructure as code
✅ CI/CD pipeline (GitHub Actions)
✅ Admin dashboard with chunk visualization
✅ PostgreSQL database with Prisma ORM
✅ Redis job queue for async processing
✅ Comprehensive documentation

**Differentiation:**
- 🇪🇺 GDPR-compliant (not an afterthought)
- 🔷 TypeScript (rare in RAG space)
- ☁️ Azure-native (enterprise-ready)
- 🚀 Deploy in 1 day (not 3 months)

**Perfect for:**
- EU developers needing compliant AI
- Software agencies building client solutions
- Enterprises with data residency requirements

**Pricing:** €79 Basic / €149 Pro / €499 Enterprise

## Maker Comment Template

**Pinned Comment:**

👋 Hi Product Hunters!

I'm Jacob, and I built this because I wasted 3 months building RAG from scratch for a client project. Every tutorial was either:
- A Jupyter notebook (not deployable)
- Python-only (I'm a TypeScript dev)
- US-hosted (GDPR nightmare)

**What makes this different:**
🇪🇺 GDPR-first design (EU data residency)
🔷 TypeScript-native (full type safety)
☁️ Azure stack (enterprise-grade)
📦 Actually works (deployed and tested)

**Ask me anything!** Happy to help with:
- RAG architecture questions
- Azure OpenAI setup
- GDPR compliance for AI
- TypeScript best practices

Also: Looking for beta testers! First 10 people to comment get free Pro access ($149 value).
